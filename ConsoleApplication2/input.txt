The rain fell. The rain always fell. The rain fell on the roof, the rain fell on the road, and the rain fell on the trees. The rain was endless. The rain was quiet, but the rain was also loud. Some days, the rain would stop, but the rain would always return.

People talked about the rain. People complained about the rain. People loved the rain, and people hated the rain. The rain was life. The rain was everywhere. The rain covered the streets. The rain covered the hills. The rain never stopped.

I watched the rain. I heard the rain. I felt the rain. The rain touched my hands, and the rain touched my face. I stood in the rain. I walked through the rain. The rain was cold. The rain was constant.

Some nights, the rain was heavy. Some nights, the rain was soft. But the rain was still the rain. The rain fell and fell. The rain would not leave. The rain would not rest. The rain kept falling. The rain was here. The rain would always be here.

And so, I watched the rain. I listened to the rain. I walked in the rain. The rain fell, and I stood in the rain.
